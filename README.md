project 1 &amp; 2


In both projects 1 and 2, the main goal was to build a program for users to load, search, and display their courses easily. I had to implement the best data structure to make the program run quickly and to stay organized. I thought the binary tree was best because it is quick and organized.

Reading the files were sometimes a struggle for me, and making sure the program would search for the courses the right way. I fixed this by testing my code, changing what needs to be changed, and checking for errors if I entered something in wrong.

This project helped me learn so much about data structures! I learned lots more about coding. Especially staying organized, making good comments, and making my functions clear. In the future I will think about which data structure would best suit my project.
